# Thor #

Thor serves as a routing engine backed by tiled open source routing data. Thor is a companion to Sif which it relies heavily on to determine the appropriate graph traversal. The resulting path can be used as input for creating guidance/narrative. The name Thor was chosen as an acronym standing for: Tiled Hierarchical Open Routing and was the foundational idea around which the organization Valhalla and its Norse mythology theme was formed.

The thor library is essentially a set of various data structures and alogrithms which deal with things like: A* graph traversal, edge costing, vertex costing and path construction. It also includes methods for computing time-distance matrices, optimized routing, and isochrones.
